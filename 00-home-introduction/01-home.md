# Python — A Practical Overview

## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed to prioritize **readability, simplicity, and developer productivity**.

It is:
- interpreted
- dynamically typed
- garbage collected
- multi-paradigm (procedural, object-oriented, functional)

Python focuses more on **how humans think** than how machines work.

## How Python Executes Code (Mental Model)
- Python code is executed **line by line** by an interpreter
- No manual compilation step
- Errors appear at runtime, not compile time
- Encourages experimentation and fast feedback

This makes Python ideal for:
- learning programming
- rapid prototyping
- backend services
- automation and tooling

---

## Why Python Feels “Easy”
Python removes **cognitive overhead**:

- No type declarations
- Minimal syntax
- Meaningful indentation instead of braces
- Expressive standard library

The goal is not to hide complexity, but to **delay it until necessary**.

## Core Design Philosophy
Python follows a simple idea:

> Code is read more often than it is written.

As a result:
- clarity > cleverness
- explicit > implicit
- simple > complex

---

## Where Python Is Commonly Used
Python is used where **developer time matters more than raw execution speed**:

- Backend APIs & services
- Data processing & analysis
- Automation & scripting
- Machine learning & AI
- DevOps & tooling

Python often acts as the **orchestration layer** connecting systems.

## A Minimal Python Program

```python
print("Hello, World!")

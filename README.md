# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository documents my **Python learning journey**, from fundamentals to real-world usage.

The goal is not to rush through topics, but to:
- understand how Python works
- write clear and readable code
- build small but meaningful projects
- learn in public and document the process

This repo is structured to be **calm, progressive, and practical**.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 00-home-introduction
High-level understanding of Python:
- what Python is
- how it runs code
- why it was designed this way
- where it is commonly used

This section builds **mental models**, not syntax memory.

---

### Core Learning Sections
These folders cover Python fundamentals in a structured way:

- `01-environment-setup` → installing Python, virtual environments
- `02-basic-syntax-data` → syntax, variables, data types
- `03-operators` → expressions and precedence
- `04-control-flow` → if, loops, conditions
- `05-functions-modules` → functions, arguments, modules
- `06-strings` → string operations
- `07-collections` → lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- `08-file-handling` → working with files & OS
- `09-oops` → object-oriented programming
- `10-errors-exceptions` → error handling & debugging
- `11-multithreading` → concurrency basics
- `12-networking` → sockets & URLs
- `13-libraries-frameworks` → popular Python libraries
- `14-miscellaneous` → useful Python topics
- `15-advanced-python` → deeper internals (later stage)

Each topic is written as **short, focused notes**.

---

## 🧪 Projects (`16-projects`)
This folder contains **small projects** built while learning Python.

Each project is:
- self-contained
- runnable
- linked to concepts already learned

Projects are used to **apply concepts**, not to show off.

---

## 🧠 Meta Learning (`_meta-learning`)
This section captures things learned **around** Python:
- terminal differences (CMD vs Bash)
- environment issues
- common beginner mistakes
- learning reflections

These notes help avoid repeating mistakes and help others learn faster.

---

## 📝 Learning Style Used Here
- One concept per file
- Simple explanations first
- Examples only when helpful
- No unnecessary theory
- Projects over memorization

The focus is on **understanding**, not completion.

---

## 📅 Progress Tracking
Daily learning is tracked in:
- `daily-log.md`

This keeps progress honest and visible.

---

## 🚀 Why Learn in Public?
Learning in public:
- forces clarity
- improves consistency
- creates helpful references for others
- builds long-term discipline

This repo is both a **learning log** and a **reference**.

---

## 🧭 How to Use This Repo
- Read topics in order
- Run examples locally
- Build projects gradually
- Revisit notes when confused

This repo is meant to grow **slowly and intentionally**.

---

## 📌 Note
This repository focuses on **Python 3.x**.

Older versions (Python 2) are intentionally excluded.
